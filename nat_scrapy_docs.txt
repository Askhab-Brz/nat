1) Open PyCharm and create a new project by selecting "File" -> "New Project" from the menu.

2) Choose a location and name for your project. Click "Create" to create the project.

3) In Pycharm interpreter settings, choose "Conda Envirounment" as Python interpreter.  

4) Go to the Pycharm terminal, type and run the commands below, one by one:
	4.1) pip install scrapy
	4.2) pip install pandas 
	4.3) scrapy startproject natwest_jobs
	4.4) cd .\natwest_jobs

5) Your project structure should look like this:
/project_name
	/natwest_jobs
		/natwest_jobs
			/spiders
				__init__.py
		__init__.py
		items.py
		middlewares.py
		pipelines.py
		settings.py

Paste the file "natwest_spider.py"(the one I sent) in the '\spiders' directory 
	 
now your directory should look like this:
/project_name
	/natwest_jobs
		/natwest_jobs
			/spiders
				__init__.py
				natwest_spider.py
		__init__.py
		items.py
		middlewares.py
		pipelines.py
		settings.py

6) Open terminal and paste: 
scrapy crawl natwest_spider -o natwest_res.csv (if you want the result to be in json format - change "natwest_res.csv" to "natwest_res.json" )
run the command and wait until the script is finished.
Once it's done you will see "natwest_res.csv" or "json" file in you directory.
this file will contain all vacancies and in order to sort out the ones we don't need,
we need to run another file, called "sort.out"  
7 Place the "sort.out" file in the first "natwest_jobs" directory
 /project_name
	/natwest_jobs <- here

8 Open and run "sort.out" file
  You will see "natwest_with_salaries.csv" in the same directory

 IMPORTANT:
The code inside the "sort.out" is: 
	import pandas as pd
	df = pd.read_csv('natwest_res.csv')

	# Drop rows with empty columns or "NO_DATA" values


	# Drop rows with empty columns
	df = df.dropna()   # Drop rows with empty columns
	df = df[df != 'NO_DATA'].dropna()  # Drop rows without salary
	# Write the updated DataFrame to a new CSV file
	df.to_csv('natwest_with_salaries.csv', index=False)
If you want to see only those vacancies that have both salaries and description - leave as it is.
If you want to see all the vacancies that have description and may or may not have salaries, you'll need to remove or just comment out this line: 
		df = df[df != 'NO_DATA'].dropna()  # Drop rows without salary
